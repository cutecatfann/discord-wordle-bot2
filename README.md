# Discord Bot: Wordle + Wordle 2.0
## Mimi Pieper

Welcome to  my project born out of nostalgia, love for Wordle, and way WAY too much time on Discord. This was created in just a couple of hours over a weekend, so if there are mistakes, please fix them! (or ignore them)

This bot is perfect for anyone who loves Wordle and spends way too much time on Discord. For now, youâ€™ll need to manually host it to run, but I might set it up for public use soon!

### Backstory (feel free to ignore)
I first created a Wordle bot in C++ when I was just starting out as a developer. I looked back on it before starting this and frankly I'm shocked it ran. Now, Iâ€™ve recreated it in JavaScript with modern best practices, new features, and scalability in mind. I think it's really fun to look back how far I've come as a programmer. That project was daunting to me when I first started coding and took way too long. This, I banged out in just a few hours. I struggle at times to see how I improved and this was really cool to see.

## Current Modes
- **Classic Wordle:** Play the beloved 5-letter guessing game with your friends.
- **CrazyWord Mode:** Take on words of any length. The bot tells you how long the word is and lets you guess.
- **Custom Options:**
  - Set the number of allowed guesses with `/wordle maxguesses:10`.
  - Enable or disable guess history with `/wordle showhistory:true`.
- **Helpful Feedback:** Every guess is evaluated with emoji indicators (`ðŸŸ©`, `ðŸŸ¨`, `â¬œ`).
- **Definitions:** Win or lose, the bot fetches a definition of the word to expand your vocabulary.

## Run Your Own Bot
### Prerequisites
1. A Discord server where you have admin access.
2. Set up a bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin).

### Quick Start
1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up your bot using this guide: [Discord.js](https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin).
3. Use this pre-configured OAuth link to add the bot to your server:  
   `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=53687430144&scope=bot%20applications.commands`  
   Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your botâ€™s client ID.
   - You will need to run it again every time if you change any `slash` commands
4. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
5. Create a `config.json` file in the root and add in your secrets from Discord Developer:
```javascript
{
  "token": "",
  "clientId": ""
}

```
6. Create a `.env` file as well and add in your Discord token:
```javascript
DISCORD_TOKEN=""

```
5. Start the bot: `node index.js`.

## Code Overview

### GameState
Managing multiple users playing Wordle simultaneously requires multiple management of data. Instead of storing this data directly in individual command handlers, I created a shared GameState. This centralized state ensures consistency and lets all game variations (Wordle, CrazyWord, and more) operate smoothly. Furthermore, it is fast, which is a requirement for using Discord's API.

### WordleGame Class
I noticed a lot of overlapping logic between Wordle and CrazyWordâ€”things like evaluating guesses, fetching definitions, and handling game flow. So, I refactored that logic into a reusable WordleGame class. Now, any new game variations can inherit this functionality, reducing redundancy and keeping the code DRY. This makes the bot highly scalable for future updates. I plan on adding a lot more to the code :)

### Word Definition
I do use the API from Free Dicitonary API for word defintions [link here](https://dictionaryapi.dev/). This isn't perfect, I notice a lot of missing definitions happen, but it is pretty good.

## Word Sources
The words come from the [english-words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) repository. I parsed the master text file locally to create different word lists. Thank you, DWYL!

### Word Lists
There are about 460k words in the English language, they are pretty much all included here. 

However, since Discord has a 3 second API time out, I wanted to ensure that the lists of words were not overly large. Here are the counts of the included lists.

Feel free to run the count function in `word_parser.py` for the numbers yourself.

For CrazyWord mode, the bot uses the full list. In Classic Wordle, itâ€™s restricted to 5-letter words.

---

## Planned Features
1. **Odd Word Mode:** Play Wordle with words containing non-alphabetic characters (e.g., `o'clock` or `co-op`).
2. **Custom Word Lengths:** Choose how many letters your Wordle word will have.
3. **Urban Dictionary Wordle:** Guess words from Urban Dictionary definitions for an extra challenge.

## Why Grumpy Cat?

Because the Discord documentation made me pull my hair out.

If youâ€™re reading this, I hope you enjoy the bot as much as I enjoyed creating it. Feel free to fork, clone, or contribute to the project.
